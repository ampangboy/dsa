# Exercises
## 1.1-1
Give a real-world example in which one of the following computational problems
appears: sorting, determining the best order for multiplying matrices, or finding
the convex hull.

**Sorting: Sorting number in non-decreasing (increasing) order**

**Determining the best order for multiplying matrices: there are many multiplication legal multiplication order and  the computation is expensive depending on number of nth matrices**

**finding the convex hull: the smaller polygon containing point in GIS world**

## 1.1-2
Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world
setting?

**Space and correctness**

## 1.1-3
Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and
limitations.

**Link-List: I have no idea its strenghts and limitation**

## 1.1-4
How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar?
How are they different?

**Shortest-path only consider two point, the shortest distance between A to B, while traveling-salesman, need to consider all the location in which the salesman need to travel**

## 1.1-5
Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then
come up with one in which a solution that is “approximately” the best is good
enough.
**Best Solution: Computational expensive like machine learning which need to process image in real-time**
**Good Enough: simple web application**
